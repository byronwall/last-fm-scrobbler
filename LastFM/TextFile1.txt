
s=<sessionID>
    The Session ID string as returned by the handshake. Required.
a[0]=<artist>
    The artist name. Required.
t[0]=<track>
    The track title. Required.
i[0]=<time>
    The time the track started playing, in UNIX timestamp format (integer number of seconds since 00:00:00, January 1st 1970 UTC). This must be in the UTC time zone, and is required.
o[0]=<source>
    The source of the track. Required, must be one of the following codes:

    P
        Chosen by the user
    R
        Non-personalised broadcast (e.g. Shoutcast, BBC Radio 1)
    E
        Personalised recommendation except Last.fm (e.g. Pandora, Launchcast)
    L
        Last.fm (any mode). In this case, the 5-digit Last.fm recommendation key must be appended to this source ID to prove the validity of the submission (for example, "o[0]=L1b48a").
    U
        Source unknown

    Please note, for the time being, sources other than P and L are not supported.
r[0]=<rating>
    A single character denoting the rating of the track. Empty if not applicable.

    L
        Love (on any mode if the user has manually loved the track). This implies a listen.
    B
        Ban (only if source=L). This implies a skip, and the client should skip to the next track when a ban happens.
    S
        Skip (only if source=L)

    Note: Currently, a web-service must also be called to set love/ban status. We anticipate that this will be phased out soon, and the submission service will handle the whole process.
l[0]=<secs>
    The length of the track in seconds. Required when the source is P, optional otherwise.
b[0]=<album>
    The album title, or empty if not known.
n[0]=<tracknumber>

m[0]=<mb-trackid>
    The MusicBrainz Track ID, or empty if not known.

Key-value pairs are separated by an '&' character, in the usual manner for form submissions in HTTP. The values given to the keys must be converted to UTF-8 first, and must be URL encoded. Multiple submissions may be specified by repeating the a[], t[], b[], m[], l[], and i[] key-value pairs with increasing indices.
